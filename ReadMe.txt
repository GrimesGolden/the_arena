This is the arena
A shitty work in progress.

What you should find upon running is a text based fighting game playable in the browser.
I suggest you play as the hobo, as his special move is currently broken af.

To play this game do the following, download all the Java software online so it's up to date, next put all these files into one folder in your desktop. Then open terminal (or on pc it's called something else.) Change directories until the terminal is open onto the folder holding all these files. Then type "java Game" into the folder.

Alternatively if you have an editor that can run and compile just run "Game.java"

Good luck.
